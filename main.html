    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It helps in understanding how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large datasets. A lower time complexity indicates a more efficient algorithm, as it will take less time to execute.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to run, relative to the size of the input. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. Understanding space complexity is crucial for optimizing memory usage in algorithms, particularly in environments with limited resources.
