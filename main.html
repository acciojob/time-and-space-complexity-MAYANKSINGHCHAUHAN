    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <!-- Time Complexity Explanation -->
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster performance.</p>
    
    <!-- Space Complexity Explanation -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It is commonly expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe the worst-case memory usage.</p>
